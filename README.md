🏥 Hospital Analytics Dashboard
📘 Project Overview

The Hospital Analytics Dashboard is an end-to-end Power BI reporting solution designed to analyze hospital operations, patient journeys, doctor performance, medicine utilization, and billing trends. Built using robust data modeling, ETL pipelines, and advanced DAX measures, the dashboard transforms complex hospital data into actionable insights for management, operations teams, and healthcare decision-makers.

This multi-page dashboard brings together patient admissions, doctor activities, medicine tracking, bed occupancy, surgeries, and revenue — giving a 360° view of hospital performance.
Data, visuals, and KPIs are sourced from structured datasets and refined through Power Query, ensuring clean, standardized, and analysis-ready information.
